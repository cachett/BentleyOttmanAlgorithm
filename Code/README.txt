This is an implementation in Python of the Bentley-Ottman algorithm which is aimed to find intersections
between segments in space with a complexity of O(nlogn) instead of O(n^2) for the naive algorithm.

Example of use:
./bo.py example.bo

NB: better if used with terminology since it displays pictures in the terminal.
